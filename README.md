# R4DS_v2 


#### A documentation of the lessons learnt from the book R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

This project and the scripts therein are produced while learning R using the book R for Data Science. The objective of the book is to 
teach how to:
* Get data into R
* Get it into the most useful structure
* Transform data
* Visualize data
* Model data

The book is divided into 5 main Sections -*Explore, Wrangle, Program, Model and Communicate* - with several chapters in each. I have therefore organized the scripts according to their Section.

## Explore
The explore section will largely be an introduction to *ggplot2()* and how to use the package for data visualization.
